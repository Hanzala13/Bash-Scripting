Bash scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks, manage system operations, and streamline workflows in Linux and Unix-based systems. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command-line interpreter that allows users to write scripts—a series of commands stored in a file—to perform repetitive or complex tasks efficiently.

Bash is used to run commands and write scripts on Unix/Linux systems.

Bash is the default shell on most Linux and macOS systems.
